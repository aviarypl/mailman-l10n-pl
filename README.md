# mailman-l10n-pl
Polish Mailman translation and localization for 2.1 branch.

The difference between this repository and upstream is encoding.
We work on Mailman l10n files encoded in UTF-8 [here](https://github.com/aviarypl/mailman-l10n-pl) and
later they are ISO-8859-2 reencoded and imported to [Mailman 2.1](https://code.launchpad.net/~mailman-coders/mailman/2.1)
([more](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-i18n/2015-February/001854.html)).
